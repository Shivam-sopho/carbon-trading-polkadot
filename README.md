## Idea Objectives 
One stop solution for generating, lending and selling carbon credits.

## Solution 
1. From an end-user perspective, our application will focus on 3 major areas:-
    
    a. Generation of Carbon Credits
    
    b. Allow users to borrow stable coins on Polkadot Substrate network by keeping their Carbon Credits as collateral.
    
    c. Allow users to sell their Carbon Credits in exchange of stable coins on Polkadot Substrate Network.
2. From a macroeconomic perspective, our application will focus on the following:-
3. We, as an organization, can use the accumulated Carbon Credits from user and sell them to organizations (private companies / govt agencies / countries) who need them to offset for their carbon emissions as per The Paris Agreement. 
4. All these transactions will be recorded on the Polkadot Substrate network Blockchain to benefit from the immutable, decentralized ledger technology.

## Projects using it

Below you find a few projects that use this boilerplate, a variation of it, or have a similar setup that inspired it:

## Getting Started

### Frontend

```bash
# 1. Install pnpm (https://pnpm.io/installation)
npm i -g pnpm

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Copy & fill environments
# NOTE: Documentation of environment variables can be found in the according `.example` file
# NOTE: Start with only the alephzero-testnet
cp packages/frontend/.env.local.example packages/frontend/.env.local
```

### Contracts

```bash
# 1. Install Rust: https://docs.substrate.io/install/
# NOTE: Leave out the "Compile a Substrate node" part for now
rustup component add rust-src
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 2. Install ink! tooling (https://use.ink/getting-started/setup#ink-cli)
cargo install cargo-contract --force --locked --git https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract.git // Don't run
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link --force --locked

# 3. Install local substrate-contracts-node (https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)
cargo install contracts-node --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git
```

## Development

### Frontend Quickstart

```bash
# NOTE: Can be executed in both, the root-dir or in `packages/frontend/`

# Start Frontend (Next.js)
pnpm dev
```
